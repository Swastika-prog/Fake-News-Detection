# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting **fake news articles** using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their content.

## 📂 Project Overview
The notebook demonstrates the complete machine learning pipeline:
- Data collection and exploration
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF / CountVectorizer
- Model training using classification algorithms
- Model evaluation and accuracy reporting
- Prediction of new/unseen articles

## 🛠 Features
- Preprocesses raw news text into clean data
- Extracts features using TF-IDF Vectorization
- Trains models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM
- Evaluates models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Predicts whether a given article is **real** or **fake**

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains:
- **Title** – Headline of the article
- **Text** – Main content of the article
- **Label** – 1 = Fake, 0 = Real

(*Replace this with the actual dataset details if you have them.*)

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Install the required libraries:
